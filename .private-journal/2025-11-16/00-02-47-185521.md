## Project Notes

**OpenVine Zendesk Integration - Navigation Fix**

Fixed ticket interaction issue in iOS app where tapping tickets in "View Past Messages" did nothing.

**Root Cause**: Missing UINavigationController wrapper around RequestUi.buildRequestList() in AppDelegate.swift:208-223

**Files Modified**:
- `ios/Runner/AppDelegate.swift` - Wrapped requestListScreen in UINavigationController before presenting

**Testing**:
- User confirmed Conversations was enabled in Zendesk admin
- Build in progress to test fix
- Expected: Tapping tickets now opens conversation view with reply capability

**Zendesk Integration Status**:
✅ Silent ticket creation (ZDKRequestProvider)
✅ Ticket list display (RequestUi.buildRequestList)
✅ "Contact Support" button working
✅ Content reporting creates tickets via ContentReportingService
🔄 Testing ticket interaction (navigation fix in progress)
