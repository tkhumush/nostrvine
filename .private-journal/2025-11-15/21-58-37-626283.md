## Project Notes

Created build_dmg.sh script for macOS distribution builds:
- Automatically builds Flutter macOS release app
- Signs with Developer ID Application certificate
- Creates compressed DMG with Applications symlink
- Signs final DMG for distribution
- Outputs ~77MB DMG file for direct download distribution

Script location: mobile/build_dmg.sh
Output: mobile/build/diVine-macOS-YYYYMMDD-HHMMSS.dmg

Next steps for distribution:
1. Notarize DMG with Apple: xcrun notarytool submit
2. Staple notarization: xcrun stapler staple
3. Verify: spctl --assess
4. Distribute to users

Documented in .claude/CLAUDE.md under Build/Test Commands and Native Build Scripts sections.
