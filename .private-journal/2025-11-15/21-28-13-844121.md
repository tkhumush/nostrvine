## Project Notes

Rabble is frustrated that "Contact Support" is showing the email share sheet instead of Zendesk. The issue is that we only implemented Zendesk platform channels for iOS and Android, not macOS.

Current situation:
- macOS app shows email share sheet (fallback behavior)
- iOS/Android would show Zendesk native UI (not tested yet)
- Rabble seems to expect it to work on macOS too

Need to clarify:
1. Does Rabble want Zendesk on macOS? (Would need macOS platform channel implementation)
2. Or is the email fallback acceptable for desktop, but we should test on iOS/Android?
3. Or should the fallback be different (e.g., open web URL instead of email)?

The Zendesk Support SDK documentation I reviewed earlier showed iOS and Android SDKs only - no macOS SDK. So we'd need to either:
- Use Zendesk web widget for macOS
- Keep email fallback for macOS
- Direct users to divine.video/support on macOS
