## Project Notes

## Added Delete Account Option to Profile Edit Menu

**Change**: Modified the "Edit Profile" button on the user's own profile to show a bottom sheet menu with two options:
1. Edit Profile - Navigate to profile editing screen
2. Delete Account and Data - Trigger account deletion flow

**Implementation**:
- Modified `_editProfile()` in `profile_screen_router.dart` to show a modal bottom sheet
- Added `_handleDeleteAccount()` method with full NIP-62 deletion flow
- Imported `delete_account_dialog.dart` for the warning/completion dialogs
- Uses same deletion logic as Settings screen for consistency

**UX Flow**:
1. User taps "Edit Profile" button on their profile
2. Bottom sheet appears with two options
3. Selecting "Delete Account and Data" shows double-confirmation warnings
4. After confirmation, executes NIP-62 deletion and removes keys
5. Shows completion dialog with option to create new account

**Files modified**:
- `lib/screens/profile_screen_router.dart` - Added menu and deletion handler
- No changes needed to Settings screen - already uses correct wording

This makes the delete account option more accessible from the profile screen while maintaining the same safety checks.
