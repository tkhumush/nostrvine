## Project Notes

## Discover Lists Improvements

Fixed the Discover Lists screen to address Rabble's feedback from the screenshot:

**Problem**: Screen was showing many empty lists (0 videos), creating a poor user experience with just rows of "My List" entries with no content.

**Solution implemented**:
1. **Filter empty lists**: Added `.where((list) => list.videoEventIds.isNotEmpty)` to exclude any lists with 0 videos
2. **Sort by popularity**: Added `.sort((a, b) => b.videoEventIds.length.compareTo(a.videoEventIds.length))` to show most popular (most videos) first

**Code location**: `/Users/rabble/code/andotherstuff/openvine/mobile/lib/screens/discover_lists_screen.dart` in `_loadPublicLists()` method (lines 44-48)

**Impact**: Users will now only see lists that have actual video content, sorted from most to least videos. This creates a much better discovery experience.

**Analysis passed**: flutter analyze shows no issues with the changes.
