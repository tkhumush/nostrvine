## Project Notes

**OpenVine Bug Reporting Migration**

Current system has issues:
- Cloudflare Worker endpoint custom-built and unreliable
- Multiple fallback paths (NIP-17, Blossom, email) are overly complex
- Rabble wants to swap to Zendesk

Zendesk SDK options:
1. **Official Native SDKs** (iOS/Android only):
   - https://github.com/zendesk/support_sdk_ios
   - https://github.com/zendesk/support_sdk_android
   - Actively maintained by Zendesk
   - No Flutter wrapper, no macOS/web support
   
2. **Community Flutter Package** (zendesk_messaging):
   - Unmaintained ("no much time to maintain regularly")
   - 12 months stale
   - No macOS/web support
   - Unverified uploader

Rabble is okay with no macOS support since it's "tiny portion of users" - macOS is just dev platform.

**Decision**: Need to choose between:
A) Use official native SDKs + write our own Flutter platform channels
B) Use community package (risky, unmaintained)
C) Fork community package and maintain it ourselves

Option A is most robust but requires platform channel implementation work.
