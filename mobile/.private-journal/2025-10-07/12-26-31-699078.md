## Project Notes

Default video title feature complete:
- Location: lib/screens/pure/video_metadata_screen_pure.dart:42 and lib/screens/pure/vine_preview_screen_pure.dart:44
- Test coverage: test/screens/default_video_title_test.dart with 4 comprehensive tests
- Both screens now default to "Do it for the Vine!" title
- Users can still override the default by typing a custom title
