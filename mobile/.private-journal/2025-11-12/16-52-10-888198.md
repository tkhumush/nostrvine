## Project Notes

Noticed separate issue in logs: M3U8 video caching creates corrupted files on first attempt, requires retry. Error: "OSStatus error -12847" (format not supported). Video URL: https://stream.divine.video/.../playlist.m3u8. System detects corruption and retries successfully. May need investigation but not blocking autoplay fix.
