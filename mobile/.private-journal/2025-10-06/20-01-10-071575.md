## Project Notes

Fixed critical camera permission bug in OpenVine mobile app:
- Issue: Permission dialog not appearing on iOS or macOS
- Root: Async callback anti-pattern in UniversalCameraScreenPure
- Fixed by separating async initialization into properly-awaited method
- File: lib/screens/pure/universal_camera_screen_pure.dart
- Added extensive logging to trace permission flow
- Verified build succeeds on macOS (divine.app)
