## Project Notes

Aggressive video caching implemented for demo-quality performance:

**Files Modified**:
- lib/services/video_cache_manager.dart - Increased limits to 2000 videos / 2GB
- lib/widgets/video_page_view.dart - Expanded prewarming to -3/+10 videos  
- lib/services/video_event_service.dart - Added eager background caching on video arrival

**Result**: Videos start caching the moment they arrive from Nostr, ensuring instant playback when user scrolls to them.

**TestFlight Ready**: Configured for maximum demo impact - scrolling should feel instant.
