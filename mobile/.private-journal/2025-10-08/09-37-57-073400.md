## Project Notes

Fixed video controller dispose crash:
- Location: lib/providers/individual_video_providers.dart
- Added ref.mounted checks in error handlers (line 191, 194)
- Wrapped background caching in unawaited() (line 127)
- Prevents crashes when videos timeout after user scrolls away
- Critical for aggressive prewarming strategy where many controllers exist
