## Project Notes

Permission fix complete ✅:
- Modified _performAsyncInitialization() to bypass permission_handler
- User confirmed working: "the permission fix works"
- Both Settings return and fresh launch now work correctly

New issue: Videos playing in background during camera recording
- Need to investigate video pause/stop logic when camera screen opens
- Check VideoStopNavigatorObserver implementation
- May need to add lifecycle handling to camera screen
