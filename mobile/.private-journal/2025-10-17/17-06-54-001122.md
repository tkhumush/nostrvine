## Project Notes

## OpenVine Mobile Architecture Cleanup

Completed removal of dual active video provider pattern:

**DELETED**:
- `computed_active_video_provider.dart` - Imperative provider with epoch-based ownership
- `video_overlay_manager_provider.dart` - Bridge for modal playback
- `VideoPageView` widget - Used epoch-based context management
- `video_overlay_modal.dart` / `video_overlay_modal_compact.dart` - Modal playback UI
- 6 test files for above components

**CREATED**:
- `video_controller_cleanup.dart` - Simple helper: `disposeAllVideoControllers(ref)` invalidates `individualVideoControllerProvider` family

**ARCHITECTURE NOW**:
- Single source of truth: `activeVideoIdProvider` (router-driven)
- ProfileScreenRouter builds PageView.builder directly like HomeScreenRouter
- No more imperative context management
- All video lifecycle tied to URL state

**Hashtag Feed Reactivity Fix**:
- Provider now continuously listens to VideoEventService
- Rebuilds automatically when relay sends new videos (500ms debounce)
- Fixes "No videos found" appearing while videos are loading from relay
