## Project Notes

## ProofMode Test Compatibility

Fixed test API compatibility issues caused by ProofMode integration.

### Remaining Work:
- 12 analyzer errors remain in unrelated files (not ProofMode-related)
- Most are in feed_navigation_test.dart (VideoEvent API changes)
- Some in example_service_test.dart (missing example service)

### ProofMode Status: Complete
- All ProofMode core functionality: ✅
- Documentation: ✅
- Performance tests: ✅
- Test API compatibility: ✅
- 35/35 core ProofMode tests passing
- Reduced analyzer errors by 15 (27 → 12)
