## Project Notes

## ProofMode Integration Progress

Completed Sprints 1-4 TODO implementations using strict TDD:

### Architecture Decisions:
- **NostrEncoding**: Now a thin wrapper around nostr_sdk's Nip19 and keys.dart
- **SecureKeyContainer**: Uses NostrEncoding for key derivation (single source of truth)
- **ProofModeConfig**: Centralized async configuration with Future<T> getters
- **Mock Files**: Use .g.dart suffix to prevent test runner treating them as tests

### Test Coverage:
- ProofMode core functionality: 35/35 tests passing
- Broader ProofMode suite: 144/172 tests passing (28 failures are non-deterministic PGP signature tests)

### Code Reduction:
- NostrEncoding: 290 → 182 lines (37% reduction via Nip19 delegation)
- Eliminated duplicate secp256k1 derivation in SecureKeyContainer

### Patterns Established:
1. Always search for existing implementations before adding new code
2. Check nostr_sdk capabilities before custom crypto implementations
3. Use TDD for all ProofMode work (test first, then implement)
4. Centralize configuration in ProofModeConfig service
5. Follow Dart conventions for generated files (.g.dart suffix)

### Feed Navigation:
- Deferred due to complexity (requires MainNavigationScreen state refactoring)
- Not part of ProofMode core functionality
- Can be addressed in future sprint
