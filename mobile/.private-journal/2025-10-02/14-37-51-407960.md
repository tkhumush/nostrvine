## Project Notes

CLAUDE.md has outdated upload architecture info - mentions fallback to api.openvine.co but Rabble says they're trying to just use Blossom. Need to verify actual current state and update docs accordingly. The CLAUDE.md is supposed to be the source of truth, so having it wrong is a problem.
