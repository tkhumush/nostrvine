## Project Notes

OpenVine uses an embedded relay architecture where the app connects to ws://localhost:7447 instead of external relays directly. The EmbeddedNostrRelay handles external relay connections. This is a critical architectural detail that I need to remember - NostrService should NEVER use nostr_sdk/relay/Relay to connect to external relays.

Current focus is on the upload system using Blossom server with fallback to api.openvine.co backend.
