**Submission ID**: 5fcafd59-7758-494d-bcab-9bcd54ec0b24
**Review Date**: November 5, 2025
**Response Date**: November 6, 2025

## Issue 1: iPad Screenshots (Guideline 2.3.3)

**Apple's Concern**: "The 13-inch iPad screenshots show an iPhone image that has been modified or stretched to appear to be an iPad image."

**Resolution**:
✅ **FIXED** - We have replaced all iPad screenshots with authentic iPad captures taken directly on iPad devices at the correct native resolutions:
- 12.9" iPad Pro: 2048x2732 screenshots
- 11" iPad Pro: 1668x2388 screenshots

Screenshots now accurately represent the app running natively on iPad hardware without any stretching or modification.

## Issue 2: Background Audio (Guideline 2.5.4)

**Apple's Concern**: "The app declares support for audio in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist, but we are unable to play any audible content when the app is running in the background."

**Resolution**:
✅ **FIXED** - We have removed the audio background mode declarations from `ios/Runner/Info.plist`:
- Removed `AVInitialRouteSharingPolicy` key
- Removed `AVAudioSessionCategoryPlayback` key

**Rationale**: diVine is a short-form video app similar to Vine/TikTok. Videos play only when the app is in the foreground and in focus. We do not provide background audio playback, so these keys were incorrectly included and have now been removed.

## Issue 3: Bluetooth Background Modes (Guideline 2.5.4)

**Apple's Concern**: "The app declares support for bluetooth-central and bluetooth-peripheral in the UIBackgroundModes key in your Info.plist but we are unable to locate any Bluetooth Low Energy functionality."

**Resolution**:
✅ **VERIFIED** - diVine does **NOT** declare `bluetooth-central` or `bluetooth-peripheral` in `UIBackgroundModes`.

**Clarification**: The app includes Bluetooth **usage descriptions** (NSBluetoothAlwaysUsageDescription) to explain our peer-to-peer sync feature, but we do **NOT** request background Bluetooth modes. These usage descriptions are required by iOS to request Bluetooth permissions at runtime, but they do not imply background operation.

**P2P Sync Feature**: The app includes an optional peer-to-peer video sync feature using Bluetooth for device discovery (not currently enabled in this release). When enabled, Bluetooth is only used in the foreground for discovering nearby devices, not for background communication.

## Issue 4: User-Generated Content Moderation (Guideline 1.2)

**Apple's Concern**: "App includes user-generated content but does not have all the required precautions."

**Resolution**: ✅ **FULLY IMPLEMENTED**

### 4a. Terms of Service with Zero Tolerance Policy

**Status**: ✅ **COMPLETE**

Our Terms of Service at **https://divine.video/terms** explicitly states:

> **Zero Tolerance for Objectionable Content and Abusive Users**

We employ multiple content filtering methods:

**Automated Filtering**:
