## Project Notes

## OpenVine Code Cleanup - Duplicate File Analysis (2025-10-14)

### Findings from Duplicate File Search

Found 4 sets of duplicate filenames in the codebase:

1. **async_utils.dart** (SAFE TO REMOVE core/async version)
   - `lib/core/async/async_utils.dart` - Simple version, only used by its own test
   - `lib/utils/async_utils.dart` - Comprehensive version with logging, used 8 times
   - **Action**: Remove core/async version + test (unused in production code)

2. **feature_flag_service.dart** (NEED TO INVESTIGATE)
   - `lib/features/feature_flags/services/feature_flag_service.dart` - 3 imports
   - `lib/services/feature_flag_service.dart` - 8 imports
   - **Action**: Need to consolidate - services version more widely used

3. **video_feed_item.dart** (MODELS VERSION UNUSED)
   - `lib/models/video_feed_item.dart` - 0 imports (UNUSED!)
   - `lib/widgets/video_feed_item.dart` - 16 imports (actively used)
   - **Action**: Remove models version if it's truly unused

4. **video_network_service.dart** (BOTH UNUSED!)
   - `lib/features/video/network/video_network_service.dart` - 0 imports
   - `lib/services/video_network_service.dart` - 0 imports
   - **Action**: Both appear completely unused - remove both?

### Also Fixed
- Removed 2 unused imports from `test/widgets/app_lifecycle_video_pause_test.dart`

### Pattern
The codebase seems to have gone through a refactoring where code was moved from `lib/services/` to feature-specific directories like `lib/features/*/services/`, but the old files weren't always cleaned up.
