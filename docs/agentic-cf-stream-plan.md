# Agentic Programming Plan: Cloudflare Video Caching for Short-Form Content
## Build Today in 6 Hours Using Claude Code

## Executive Summary

**CRITICAL INSIGHT**: These are 6-second vine videos (1-10MB each), NOT long-form content! This dramatically simplifies our architecture.

**SIMPLIFIED STRATEGY**: 
- Store entire videos in R2 (no chunking needed)
- Use aggressive multi-tier caching (L1: Device, L2: CDN Edge, L3: R2)
- Focus on instant playback and smart prefetching

**Today's Goal**: Build a fast, simple video delivery system optimized for short-form content consumption patterns.

## Agentic Development Strategy

### Core Principles
1. **Simplicity First**: 6-second videos eliminate complex chunking logic
2. **Instant Playback**: Videos should start immediately from cache
3. **Smart Prefetching**: Preload next 3-5 videos as user scrolls
4. **Mobile Optimized**: Multiple quality renditions for different network conditions

## Technical Architecture

### Simplified Storage Strategy
- **Cloudflare R2**: Stores complete video files (1-10MB each)
- **Cloudflare KV**: Video metadata and rendition URLs
- **CDN Edge Cache**: Automatic caching of popular videos at edge locations
- **Device Cache**: Client-side caching of recently viewed videos

### Request Flow
```
Mobile App → Check Device Cache → CDN Edge Cache → CF Worker → 
Check R2 → Return Signed URL → Prefetch Next Videos
```

## 6-Hour Implementation Plan

### Phase 1: Simple Video Delivery (1.5 hours)
**Goal**: Basic video serving from R2 with CDN caching

#### Task 1.1: Video Metadata API (30 minutes)
```typescript

- Return JSON with video metadata and signed R2 URL
- Support multiple quality renditions (480p, 720p)
- Add short-lived URL signing (5 minute expiry)
- Handle missing videos gracefully

Response format:
{
  "videoId": "abc123",
  "duration": 6.0,
  "renditions": {
    "480p": "https://r2-signed-url/video_480.mp4",
    "720p": "https://r2-signed-url/video_720.mp4"
  },

Response format:
{
  "videos": [...video objects...],
  "nextCursor": "cursor_token",
  "prefetchCount": 5

## Deployment & Testing Plan

### Immediate Testing (Throughout Development)
1. **Unit Tests**: Each component has comprehensive tests
2. **Integration Tests**: End-to-end request flows
3. **Performance Tests**: Cache hit rates, response times
4. **Load Tests**: Handle concurrent requests

### Deployment Strategy
1. **Local Development**: Use miniflare for all testing
2. **Staging Deploy**: Deploy to Cloudflare Workers staging
3. **Internal Testing**: Test with actual OpenVine mobile app
4. **Gradual Rollout**: Start with 1% of users via feature flag

## Agentic Task Execution Strategy

### Claude Code Session Management
1. **One task per session**: Focus on single, well-defined component
2. **Clear requirements**: Specific inputs, outputs, error handling
3. **Immediate testing**: Validate each component before proceeding
4. **Iterative refinement**: Test, debug, enhance in tight loops

### Parallel Development Opportunities
- Tasks 1.1, 1.2, 1.3 can be built simultaneously
- Tasks 2.1, 2.2, 2.3 are independent and can be parallel
- Frontend and backend work can overlap

### Success Criteria for Each Phase
- **Phase 1**: Can proxy video requests without caching
- **Phase 2**: Cache hit rate >80% on repeated requests
- **Phase 3**: No security vulnerabilities, comprehensive logging
- **Phase 4**: Mobile app successfully uses proxy service

## Risk Mitigation

### Technical Risks
1. **R2 Performance**: Test with real video sizes early
2. **Memory Usage**: Monitor Worker memory consumption
3. **Stream API Limits**: Implement proper rate limiting
4. **Network Timeouts**: Add appropriate timeout handling

### Development Risks
1. **Scope Creep**: Stick to MVP features only
2. **Integration Issues**: Test mobile app integration early
3. **Performance Issues**: Profile and optimize continuously
4. **Deployment Problems**: Use staging environment first

## Expected Outcomes for Short-Form Video Optimization

### End of Day Results
1. **Instant video playback**: Sub-second start times for cached videos
2. **Smart prefetching**: Next 3-5 videos preloaded automatically  
3. **Multi-quality support**: 480p/720p renditions based on network
4. **Mobile optimized**: Device caching and intelligent quality switching
5. **Production ready**: Secure API with rate limiting and monitoring

### Performance Targets (Short-Form Optimized)
- **Cache Hit Rate**: >95% for popular videos (CDN edge cache)
- **First Video Load**: <2s (from R2 + CDN)
- **Cached Video Load**: <500ms (instant playback)
- **Prefetch Success**: 90% of next videos ready before user swipes
- **Bandwidth Efficiency**: 50% reduction via quality adaptation

### Success Metrics
- **User Experience**: Instant playback for 95% of videos
- **Network Efficiency**: Average 2MB per video (480p default)
- **Cost**: <$50/month for 100K short videos (6-second average)
- **Reliability**: >99.9% API availability
- **Mobile Performance**: Smooth scrolling with zero loading delays

### Key Optimizations for Short-Form Content
1. **Simplified Architecture**: No chunking complexity needed
2. **Aggressive Caching**: Entire 1-10MB videos cached at edge
3. **Quality Ladder**: Start 480p, upgrade to 720p when available
4. **Predictive Loading**: Prefetch based on scroll velocity
5. **Device Storage**: Recently viewed videos cached locally

This streamlined approach leverages the unique characteristics of short-form content (small file sizes, sequential consumption) to deliver a significantly better user experience with simpler architecture.
