# ProofMode Human Testing Plan

## Overview

This document outlines comprehensive human testing procedures for validating OpenVine's ProofMode implementation. The testing plan ensures that ProofMode accurately distinguishes between real human-captured content and bot-generated content while supporting creative recording styles.

## Testing Objectives

### Primary Goals
1. **Bot Detection Accuracy**: Verify >95% success rate in detecting automated/bot recordings
2. **Human Recognition Accuracy**: Verify >98% success rate in recognizing legitimate human recordings  
3. **Creative Recording Support**: Ensure stop-motion, time-lapse, and artistic recording styles are not flagged as bots
4. **Performance Validation**: Confirm ProofMode adds <5% overhead to recording performance
5. **User Experience**: Validate that ProofMode operates invisibly to users

### Secondary Goals
1. **False Positive Minimization**: <1% false positive rate for legitimate recordings
2. **Edge Case Handling**: Proper behavior with accessibility tools, unusual devices, network issues
3. **Privacy Compliance**: Verify no sensitive data collection beyond stated requirements
