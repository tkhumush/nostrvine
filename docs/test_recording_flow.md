# OpenVine Recording and Publishing Flow Test

## Test Date: 2025-01-18

### Fixed Issues:
1. ✅ **macOS Recording Issue**: Fixed `isSingleRecordingMode` flag being cleared too early
2. ✅ **Publishing Null Check Error**: Fixed null check operator issue with `_currentUploadId`  
3. ✅ **Upload Metadata Update**: Added `updateUploadMetadata` method to UploadManager
4. ✅ **Background Upload**: Upload now starts automatically when entering metadata screen
5. ✅ **Concurrent Publishing**: Can now publish while upload is in progress

### Test Steps:

1. **Record Video**:
   - Open OpenVine app on macOS
   - Click camera tab (center button)
   - Grant camera permission if prompted
   - Hold record button for 3-6 seconds
   - Release to stop recording
   - ✅ Should NOT show "No valid video segments found" error

2. **Enter Metadata**:
   - Should automatically navigate to metadata screen
   - ✅ Background upload should start immediately (progress bar at top)
   - Add title (required)
   - Add description (optional)
   - Add hashtags (optional, #openvine added by default)
   - Toggle expiring post if desired

3. **Publish Video**:
   - Click PUBLISH button
   - ✅ Should allow publishing even while upload is in progress
   - ✅ Should update metadata during upload
   - Should wait for upload to complete if needed
   - Should publish to Nostr once upload finishes
   - Should navigate to profile tab showing new video

### Key Code Changes:

1. **vine_recording_controller.dart**:
   - Don't clear `isSingleRecordingMode` in `completeRecording()`
   - Only clear it in `dispose()` or when starting new recording

2. **video_metadata_screen.dart**:
   - Start upload immediately in `_startBackgroundUpload()`
   - Allow publishing while upload in progress
   - Update metadata with `updateUploadMetadata()` call
   - Handle null check properly with `upload?.status`

3. **upload_manager.dart**:
   - Added `updateUploadMetadata()` method
   - Updates title, description, hashtags on existing upload

### Success Criteria:
- ✅ Can record video on macOS without segment error
- ✅ Upload starts automatically in background
- ✅ Can publish while upload is in progress
- ✅ Metadata updates properly during upload
- ✅ Video publishes successfully to Nostr
- ✅ Video appears in profile feed

### Notes:
- The upload progress is shown at the top of metadata screen
- Publishing while uploading shows "Uploading and publishing..." message
- Metadata is preserved even if upload completes before publish button is clicked
