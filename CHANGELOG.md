## [Unreleased Changes]

### Fixed
- **Camera Screen UX Improvements**: Fixed multiple camera screen usability issues

  - iOS camera switch now properly updates preview with state notification and extensive debug logging
  - iOS pinch-to-zoom gesture support added with zoom slider UI and smooth zoom control
  - SnackBar notifications moved to top of screen to avoid covering publish button
  - Added `canSwitchCamera` field to camera state management for conditional UI rendering
  - Integrated existing `CameraControlsOverlay` widget for enhanced camera controls

- **Performance: Explore/Trending Page Hangs Eliminated**: Fixed severe performance issues causing 3-10 second freezes when opening Explore, Trending, and hashtag pages
  - Added 9 critical database indexes on `event` and `video_metrics` tables to eliminate full table scans
  - `idx_event_kind`, `idx_event_created_at`, `idx_event_kind_created_at` - for video discovery queries
  - `idx_event_pubkey`, `idx_event_kind_pubkey`, `idx_event_pubkey_created_at` - for profile/author queries
  - `idx_metrics_loop_count`, `idx_metrics_likes`, `idx_metrics_views` - for trending/popular sorting
  - Database schema version bumped to v5 with automatic migration on app restart
  - Re-enabled cache-first queries for discovery feeds (now fast with indexes)
  - Queries that previously took 3+ seconds now complete in milliseconds

- **Performance: Database Lock Contention Fixed**: Eliminated "database is locked" errors when receiving events
  - Implemented event batching in `EventRouter` with 50ms debounce timer
  - Added `upsertEventsBatch()` method using single transaction instead of individual inserts
  - Prevents 100+ concurrent INSERT statements from blocking each other
  - Events are now batched (50 events or 50ms window) for efficient bulk inserts

- **Performance: File Descriptor Leak Fixed**: Resolved "Too many open files" error from logging system
  - Changed `LogCaptureService` to use persistent `IOSink` instead of opening new file handle on every write
  - Added file rotation lock and memory-tracked file size to prevent concurrent rotation issues
  - Flush buffered logs every 100 entries to balance crash safety with I/O efficiency
  - Logging system now handles hundreds of thousands of entries without exhausting file descriptors

- **Performance: Discovery Subscription Pre-initialization Optimized**: Fixed 10-second freeze when opening Explore tab
  - Skip expensive `_preInitializeReplaceableEvents()` for discovery subscriptions (no authors filter)
  - Pre-initialization now only runs for home feed subscriptions where it's beneficial
  - Explore tab opens instantly instead of hanging for 10 seconds

- **Explore Screen Navigation**: Fixed critical bug where tapping videos in Explore tab would fail on first attempt
  - Made URL the single source of truth using `pageContextProvider` instead of internal widget state
  - ExploreScreen now derives feed/grid mode from URL `videoIndex` parameter reactively
  - Fixed `RangeError` when widget recreated due to GoRouter's different Navigator keys for grid/feed modes
  - Videos and starting index now read from `exploreTabVideosProvider`, surviving widget recreation
  - Removed unnecessary `setState()` call in hashtag loading that interfered with navigation
  - Follows proper Flutter Navigation 2.0 + Riverpod pattern where URL drives UI state

- **Profile Navigation**: Fixed issue where tapping Profile from drawer/bottom nav would skip grid view and go directly to fullscreen video feed
  - Added missing `/profile/:npub` route for grid mode (was only `/profile/:npub/:index`)
  - Fixed route parser to return `null` videoIndex for grid mode instead of defaulting to `0`
  - Fixed 'me' profile redirect to preserve grid/feed mode (was always adding `/0` to URL)

### Added (Backend: Cloudflare Stream)
- Cloudflare Stream upload and CDN integration (phase-in)
  - New POST `/v1/media/request-upload` to create Stream direct upload URLs (NIP-98 auth; per-pubkey rate limit)
  - New POST `/v1/webhooks/stream-complete` to process Stream callbacks (HMAC signature validation)
  - New GET `/v1/media/status/{videoId}` for processing state; returns HLS/DASH URLs when published
  - KV mappings for Stream: `stream:file:{fileId}` and `stream:uid:{uid}`
  - Thumbnail delivery via Cloudflare Images transformation of Stream thumbnails
  - Compatibility: `/media/{fileId}` and `/thumbnail/{fileId}` redirect to Stream/Images when migrated; fallback to R2 otherwise

### Changed (Backend: Cloudflare Stream)
- Prefer Cloudflare Stream HLS/DASH for video delivery; R2 remains a fallback path
- `/media/{fileId}` and `/thumbnail/{fileId}` updated to support redirects for migrated items
- Standardize webhook secret to `STREAM_WEBHOOK_SECRET` (ensure Wrangler secret is set)
- Enforced rate limiting for Stream uploads (30/hour per pubkey)

### Notes (Backend)
- NIP-96 `/api/upload` remains for images and legacy flows. For videos, clients should move to Stream upload flow. Transitional behavior may return processing handoff to Stream.
- GIF output is not provided by Stream; prefer HLS/short MP4. If GIFs are required, a separate processing path will be needed.

### Migration (Backend)
- Planned one-time import of existing R2 videos into Cloudflare Stream:
  - Enumerate R2 `uploads/` objects, generate signed URLs, and create Stream videos with metadata (`fileId`, `sha256`, `originalFilename`)
  - Store KV mappings and update on webhook completion
  - Keep dedup and original Vine mappings intact: `sha256:{hash}`, `vine_id:{vineId}`, `filename:{name}`
